In the context of embeddings, such as word embeddings or other types of vector embeddings used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, the values can vary depending on the type of embedding and the method used to generate them. Here are some common types and their typical value ranges:

1)Word2Vec Embeddings:

Typically range between -1 and 1.
The values are real numbers resulting from the training process.


2)GloVe Embeddings:

Also usually range between -1 and 1, but the specific range can vary slightly depending on the corpus and the training parameters.


3)FastText Embeddings:

Similar to Word2Vec, values typically range between -1 and 1.


4)BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Embeddings:

The values can have a wider range, often between -2 and 2, but it's not uncommon to see values outside this range as well.


5)GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Embeddings:

The values can vary widely, often between -5 and 5 or even more extreme, depending on the layer and the specific model architecture.


6)openai embeddings:

OpenAI embeddings often have values that can vary widely, typically ranging from around -10 to 10, but they can exceed these bounds depending on the specific model and layer.
The values are real numbers and can be positive or negative

7)Custom Embeddings:

When generating custom embeddings using deep learning models, the range of values can be influenced by the activation functions used, the normalization techniques applied, and the specifics of the training process.
