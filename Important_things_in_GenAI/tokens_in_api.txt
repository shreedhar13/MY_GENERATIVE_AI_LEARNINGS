As u know DL and NLP,,,   1token means 1 word.......
#But in GEN AI models,,,,,diff-diff orgainzatios have there own defination/rule for 1 token,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
##############################OpenAI's 1 token defination is -> 75% of word is taken as 1 token..##################
#other organization have diff-diff conventions for tokens,,so read document before using it.........
but diff diff organization have 1 token means 1 charachter (HuggingFace has this kind of terminlogu) , 1 token means 1 sentence...etc

In OpenAI ,,, token explanation is like this
	Text generation and embeddings models process text in chunks called tokens. Tokens represent commonly occurring sequences of characters. For example, the string " tokenization" is decomposed as " token" and "ization",,,(2 tokens), while a short and common word like " the" is represented as a single token. Note that in a sentence, the first token of each word typically starts with a space character. Check out our tokenizer tool to test specific strings and see how they are translated into tokens. As a rough rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words for English text.

One limitation to keep in mind is that for a text generation model the prompt and the generated output combined must be no more than the model's maximum context length. For embeddings models (which do not output tokens), the input must be shorter than the model's maximum context length. The maximum context lengths for each text generation and embeddings model can be found in the model index.

Gpt-4o is MultiModel (ie; work on both image and text data)
Processing: The model reads and generates text in tokens. The more tokens it can handle at once, the longer and more complex the tasks it can manage.
Context Window: The context window refers to the maximum number of tokens the model can keep in memory at any given time. For GPT-4o, this is 128,000 tokens. This means it can remember and consider a large amount of text when generating responses.

When we say that a model like Text-Curie-001 has a maximum token limit of 2049 tokens, it means that the total number of tokens in both the input (the text you provide to the model) and the output (the text the model generates) cannot exceed 2049 tokens. This includes:

1)Prompt Tokens      : The tokens that make up the input text you provide to the model.  prompt means QUERY/question/input

2)Completion Tokens  : The tokens generated by the model as a response/answers to Prompt . 
		
		a)### completetion api or task : Completion is answer or response w.r.t Query/Prompt...used for single question or query...ex-> t0p 5 famous cities in world  , who won the world cup in 2011?....etc

		b)### chat completetion API or task : context of chat is remebered to generate response w.r.t user query/prompt....chat completetion used for building chatBOT....ex-> works like chatgpt,,where this llm model willremeber the context or user session to generate further responses or completetion tokens.......
used for conversational kind of stuff

		c)### Function Calling : For example, if you provide an input prompt that consists of 100 tokens, the model can generate up to 1949 tokens in response, totaling 2049 tokens. If your prompt is longer, say 2000 tokens, the model can only generate up to 49 tokens in response.

Here’s a concrete example:

Prompt: "Explain the significance of the token limit in GPT-3 models and how it affects the input and output text length."
Let's say this is 20 tokens.
Response: The model can generate up to 2029 tokens in response (2049 - 20).
The token limit is important for several reasons:

Performance: It ensures that the model operates within manageable memory and computational limits.
Context Management: It helps in maintaining context. Exceeding the token limit means the model won't be able to process the entire input or generate the desired length of output.
Understanding and managing token limits is crucial when working with GPT-3 models to ensure your input and expected output fit within the constraints.


NOTE-> HugginFace has 30k character input?prompt quota for each month , for free tier users....
ie;each prompt length is deducted from this 30k quota........No output length is deducted like open Ai do..
here u have limited prompt request
ex-> if ur prompt has 100 characters,,you may get response of any length of character....here just 100 is deducted from 30K quota of this month
,,,But in open AI (1 word means 1 token)(if u buyed paid service for each month),,,suppose your prompt has 10 tokens and your quota is 2049 tokens then here you will get response containing 2049 - 10 tokens atmost....ie;no limitation over input prompt ,,,you can do any no of prompt through API,,,,,,,,just response containing tokens is adjusted w.r.t length of promt or no of token is prompt



#########context window#############

The context window size of a language model like GPT-4o Mini refers to the maximum number of tokens (words or characters) the model can consider at once when generating a response. The context window size is crucial for accuracy and coherence in the generated output.

Context Window Size Considerations
1. Understanding Context Window Size:

Context Window: The amount of text the model can "see" at once when generating responses. If the context window is too small, important details may be missed; if it’s too large, it might lead to inefficiencies or increased cost.
