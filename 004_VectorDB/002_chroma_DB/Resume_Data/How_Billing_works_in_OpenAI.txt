Billing Process Overview
Credit Card Setup

Entry: Provide your credit card details in OpenAI’s billing settings.
Verification: OpenAI verifies the card for payment processing.
Usage Tracking

API Requests: OpenAI tracks your usage of API models based on the number of tokens processed or requests made.
Model-Specific Pricing: Each model has its own token pricing (e.g., GPT-4o Mini).
Billing Cycle

Cycle Duration: Typically monthly. Usage is tracked continuously throughout this period.
Aggregation: At the end of the cycle, total usage is aggregated.
Charges and Payment

Invoice Generation: An invoice is generated detailing your usage and charges.
Automatic Deduction: The total amount due is automatically deducted from your credit card. This usually happens at the end of the billing cycle or shortly thereafter.
No Per-Request Charges: You are not charged after each individual API request; charges accumulate over the billing cycle.
Handling Payment Issues

Failed Payments: If there’s an issue (e.g., insufficient funds), OpenAI will notify you and may suspend or limit your access until resolved.
Resolution: Update your payment details or resolve the issue as needed.
Model-Specific Pricing Example

GPT-4o Mini Pricing:
Input Tokens: $0.000150 per 1,000 tokens
Output Tokens: $0.000600 per 1,000 tokens
Example Calculation: For 10,000 input tokens and 5,000 output tokens, the total cost would be $0.0045.
Monitoring and Management

Dashboard: Use OpenAI’s dashboard to monitor usage and manage billing settings.
Support: Contact support for any billing issues or discrepancies.
Key Points
Monthly Billing: Usage is tracked monthly, and charges are applied at the end of the billing cycle.
Model Pricing: Charges depend on the model used and its specific token rates.
Automatic Payment: Your credit card is automatically charged based on aggregated usage.
This process helps in managing and understanding your API costs effectively while ensuring seamless access to OpenAI’s services.
